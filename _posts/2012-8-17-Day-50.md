My last post as a Viget Intern...I've come so far in these 10 short weeks. This post is
for those who helped me along the way:
<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="http://viget.com/about#developers">The Development Team</a>, especially
  <a href="http://viget.com/about/team/deisinger">David</a>, <a href="http://viget.com/about/team/cjones">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://viget.com/about/team/zporter">Zach</a>
  here in Durham.
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="http://viget.com/about/team/mwagner">Mindy</a> and <a href="http://viget.com/about/team/msteinruck">Mark</a> who helped me with the blog design.
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="http://viget.com/about#durham-nc">Everyone in Viget South</a> for being great coworkers and providing an excellent working environment.
  </li>
  <li>
  And of course <a href="http://viget.com/about/team/bwilliams">Brian</a> and <a href="http://viget.com/about/team/arankin">Andy</a> for founding this
  awesome company, giving interns like me a chance to receive professional experience.
  </li>
</ul>

I will shamelessly promote Viget to anyone who asks, because I have seen what they can do and the quality of the products they create. It's been fun everybody.
