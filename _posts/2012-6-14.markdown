title: Heroku Rhymes with Sepuku
---

Today I completed the basic functionality of the Haxxor-News site: displaying links and allowing
visitors to post new links. I posted the pull request in campfire and got useful feedback
from Patrick so I took some time to make his suggested changes before attempting to deploy to
Heroku.
The first thing I learned was that if sqlite3 is in your gemfile, Heroku will laugh at your
pathetic attempts to git push any files. Unfortunately, if sqlite3 was not in my gemfile I could
not bring the site up on a local server. With some assistance from fellow intern Elias and a lot 
of trouble I figured out that I could
relegate sqlite3 to the development environment and postgresql to the production environment using
the 'group' command in the gemfile. This fixed the previously mentioned problem and the site is
now up at http://ssundseth-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com. Now that Heroku has been figured out I
expect tomorrow will be filled with lots of rails to add some functionality to my site.
