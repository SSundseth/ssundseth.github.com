title: Voting = Pwnd
---

Today I returned to work on the haxxor-news site, this time working on giving
users the ability to vote on articles and comments. After another epic
whiteboard session with David and Chris I was surprised to find myself 
finishing up the voting functionality in the afternoon. Granted I haven't
written any tests and the code is a bit messy, but it all works and that's what
counts.

Several of our comrades from HQ are visiting so after work we will be visiting
Happy Hour at the Geer Street Beer Garden. Too bad I'm two days from being 21.
