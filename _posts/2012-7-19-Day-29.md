title: Going Offroad
---

Today I wrote lots and lots of specs for uwharrie-offroad. The Simplecov gem was very useful in telling me how much of the app was
covered by the test suite. Once the specs were complete, I did some research on geotracking through the browser. There are plenty of
ways to get the current location of a user, but I'm not sure how feasible it will be to have constant tracking. Until I figure out more
about tracking I'm going to stick with the current plan.

In the midst of lots
of javascript I fixed some of the views with twitter bootstrap and began working on an interactive map for the front page. The css
for that is pretty cool and I like how it's turning out.
