After a week or two of tinkering, the geotracking of uwharrie-offroad finally works
like it's supposed to. Now I just navigate to the 'Add Time' link, click a button to
begin timing, and click another button when I reach the destination. The time will
automatically be posted on the site.

Since the functionality work is mostly out of the way, I've been changing some of the
site style to make it more user-friendly and less debugging-friendly. I've nearly reached
the final week of this internship and things have turned out pretty neatly.
