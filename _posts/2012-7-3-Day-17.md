title: Many New Things
---

Ideas for a new project have been flooding in, whether from my own head or from the dev
team here I've got plenty to choose from. More on that once I iron out exactly what
I'll be working on for the rest of the summer.

Today I met with Mindy, David, and Chris for a design critique of the blog and was left 
with no shortage of things to work on there either. Mindy's professionally designing
eye caught all sorts of things that I wouldn't have noticed and has been a great help
in making the blog look nice.

After the meeting I made some of those changes and am looking forward to having tomorrow
off for Independence Day. Hooray for 'merica!
