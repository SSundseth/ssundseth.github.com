title: Have a cup of Coffee
---

After realizing how cool Coffeescript is, I rewrote all the javascript functionality for uwharrie-offroad.
Some weirdness occurred when I had to bind a variable to the output of a function but overall the syntax
is much cleaner and easier to write.

Now that the geotracking is working, I've been figuring out how to have the server-side and client-side
code interact. Zach gave me a hand with this today, explaining how content_tag data can be read by
jQuery and then used within functions. We also talked about how Ajax can automatically submit a post
request to a controller, I'll use this to automatically upload times when users enter certain locations.

For the past few days I've been performing tests on my code using the drive home to send data to the
geolocation functions. Yesterday the function started a timer when I left Viget that stopped automatically
when I reached my house, so today the function will (hopefully) submit this time automatically to the site
using an Ajax post.
