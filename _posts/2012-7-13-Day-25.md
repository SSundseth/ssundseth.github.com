title: Only or Already?
---

Today I found myself at the halfway point of this internship at Viget. When I
think of the time spent working here it is most certainly with the second
adverb listed above. Already 5 weeks have gone by and I have built two websites
and contributed to a third. My rails knowledge has skyrocketed(not hard when
starting from zero), and I've been able to learn tricks of the trade from
experienced professionals. Here in Durham we all use Vi for our text-editing
so here are some of the awesome tips I've picked up:
<ul>
  <li>David: NerdTree plugin - lets you view the current directory tree
  and easily navigate through files</li>
  <li>Chris: A variety of mappings to place in vimrc that streamline file
  opening/closing as well as buffer switching</li>
  <li>Zach: Pathogen - The best plugin ever, lets you install other plugins
  just by cloning their repo into ~/.vim/bundle</li>
</ul>

My work on officegames is pretty much wrapped up, so next week I'll probably
be starting my own app from scratch. I have some good ideas and am looking
forward to that.
