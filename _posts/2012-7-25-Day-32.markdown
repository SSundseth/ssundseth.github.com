Met up with David to go over the changes I'd made for OfficeGames and found that
the specs were quite lacking. We started the branch over, this time utilizing
test driven development(TDD). This entails writing specs before any functional
code, being sure to cover every possibility. You run the tests and of course
they should all fail because you haven't actually done anything. Then, one by
one, you write code that will make the tests pass. If your test suite is
complete, you can be sure that your functional code does exactly what it's
supposed to.

Once I understood the concept, TDD seemed like a much safer way to develop so
I spent the day rewriting most of my OfficeGames update.
