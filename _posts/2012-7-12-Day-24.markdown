title: Wielding the Rake
---

Earlier today I completed the rating system for officegames, but there is one
problem: all of the existing data for the site has nothing to do with ratings. I
needed a function that would take the existing database and apply the new
system, initializing each player or team with a rating and updating them based on
existing matches. David sent me a dump of the production database so I could run
commands against a copy of the real thing. Once I had a function that did the
trick I wondered how it should be executed. The answer came from David: make it
into a rake task. This seemed daunting at first but it ended up being very
simple. All I had to do was make a .rake file in lib/tasks, give the task a
name (rating_init or something similar), point it to the database, throw in my
previously mentioned function, and run
<pre><code>$ rake rating_init</code></pre>

Now I just need one last review of the code and some tests for this task
before the new system will be ready to launch.
