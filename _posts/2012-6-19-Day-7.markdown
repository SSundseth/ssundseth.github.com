title: A Penny for your Comment
---

Managed to implement the 20 links per page view using the very handy
will\_paginate gem, then began to work on add a commenting system to the
haxxor-news site. With help from an epic whiteboard session with David and
Chris I made good progress on this aspect of the site.

This process led me to learn about such Rails topics as
resource nesting, partials, and belongs\_to/has\_many tags. The most
challenging part so far has been writing the views to facilitate comment
threading but I think that should be wrapped up tomorrow. Otherwise, Rails
is making more and more sense as I work through these features.
