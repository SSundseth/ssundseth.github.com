As promised, my project for the rest of the summer is thus: to awesomize the
pointless-corp website <a href="http://officegam.es">officegam.es</a>. This
website allows users to record their competitive events in any sort of game,
it keeps track of wins and losses for each player. The first order of business:
update the ranking algorithm, which is currently based only upon total wins.
I plan to use the Elo rating system which was originally developed for chess
organizations but has been adapted to other competitions as well.
