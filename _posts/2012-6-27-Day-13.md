title: Another day Another PR

Finished up the voting feature of haxxor-news and post the pull request. I'm
trying to adhere to the DRY(don't repeat yourself) method while using rails so
I did a bunch of cleaning up on the code too. Wrote some specs and integration
tests with Capybara to round it all out.

On the style side I finally up/down arrows for votes to be in the right place
and made some changes to the site's style. The advice I got from Mindy and 
Mark is proving useful for this site as well, the colors and typography are
much better now. Overall I'm quite pleased with how the visuals have turned
out.

Other than that, only a few things left to do on the site.
