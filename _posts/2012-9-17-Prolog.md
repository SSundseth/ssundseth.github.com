title: Logic of Life (according to Conway)
---

I'm back in the swing of things(baseball pun intended) here at Wesleyan, and therefore I
am once again knee-deep in Prolog. In honor of my return to logic-programming I thought
I would share a very cool Prolog project I worked on a while back. The program is a
simulation of <em>Conway's Game of Life</em> written, of course, in Prolog.

For those who
don't know, the Game of Life is not really a game, but a study of the evolution of an
initial configuration, with all subsequent configurations determined by a set of rules.
The board consists of a grid of <em>cells</em>, and each cell is either alive or dead.
The setup is basically selecting certain cells to be alive, and then each 'generation'
of the board is determined by the following:
<ol>
  <li> Any live cell with less than two live neighbors(adjecent cells) dies of 'loneliness'</li>
  <li> Any live cell with exactly two or three neighbors survives</li>
  <li> Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies of 'overcrowding'</li>
  <li> Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes alive through 'reproduction'</li>
</ol>

Many initial configurations lead to all cells dying, but there are a few quite interesting
setups which can survive for thousands of generations or even enter infinite loops.

Now back to my program, the <a href="https://github.com/SSundseth/prolog/blob/master/GameOfLife.prolog">code</a>
can be seen on my Github Account. To run the program, load it in a Prolog interpreter(I use SWI), and enter
the query:
<code>
  <p>
    run(SIZE, PAUSE, MATRIX).
  </p>
</code>
Where SIZE is the length of your square matrix, PAUSE is the number of seconds you want the program to wait
between generations, and MATRIX is a list of lists consisting of 0's and 1's where 1's denote live cells.
If you just want a random matrix run the query:
<code>
  <p>
    life(SIZE, PAUSE).
  </p>
</code>
I also added some default options to automatically
run certain interesting configurations. For example, querying:
<code>
  <p>
    pulsar.
  </p>
</code>
will produce the following output:

Which will continue to grow for about 30 generations until it enters
a 3-generation loop. The other examples are <em>blinker., r_pentomino.,
ten_in_a_row., glider.</em>

The Game of Life was pretty fun to implement, it gave me a lot
of insight into the recursive nature of Prolog and logic-programming itself.
