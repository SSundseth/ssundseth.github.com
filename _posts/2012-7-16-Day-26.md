title: New Project

Now that I've officially entered the second half of this internship, I'll be
working on a project of my own for the next five weeks. This project is an
app I call uwharrie-offroading, which for now lets users input their times on
the trails of Uwharrie National Forest. I want to eventually implement geotracking
so that times are uploaded automatically, but the app is still young and there
is a lot to do before that can happen.

Today I set up a user database, added authentication, and made models for
trails and for timings. Uwharrie-offroad is growing pretty quickly compared to
haxxor-news so it won't be long before I get to the cool stuff.
