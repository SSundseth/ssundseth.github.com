My first day at Viget began with meeting the Durham team, and then setting up the MacBook Pro that I was 
issued. Guided by David Eisenger and the other developers, we began downloading. With essential
software such as gcc, rvm, homebrew, and of course git, this took up most of the morning. In
between 'brew install's' was an orientation presentation given by the esteemed VP of Operations, Cindy 
Caldwell. Lunch was with the Development Team at Mellow Mushroom, which never fails to be delicious, and
the afternoon was filled with the creation of this blog using Jekyll, a website generator. 

Unfortunately, my HTML is a little rusty and so not much actual creation was accomplished, I mostly
read the Jekyll documentation and checked out some example blogs. With David's
help I pushed the directory structure to Github and hopefully tomorrow I will have the blog running
online.
