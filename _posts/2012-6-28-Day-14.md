title: Reporting mostly done

Coding up the reporting functionality of the haxxor-news site went rather
smoothly. I haven't deployed it to Heroku yet, but visitors can soon choose 
whether they want to view the newest posts, or the highest voted by day, week,
month, or all-time. I had to learn more about routing to complete this feature,
especially matching urls to actions and adding constraints to be sure the right
path sends a user to the right action.

As usual there will be lots of tests written for this
feature, gotta make sure everything works properly before sending out a pull
request and putting it on heroku. That will be finished up tomorrow and I will
be mostly done with haxxor-news functionality.
