title: Visual Heirarchy
---

If you aren't viewing this through the RSS feed, you may have noticed how much
more awesome the blog looks now compared to a few days ago. This morning I met
with the very skilled Mark/Mindy Durham design team. We looked at some examples
of succesful blog designs and talked about what exactly makes them so
visually appealing. I learned about such topics as choosing a color palette,
typography, and the visual heirarchy of important pieces of information on a
page. With these basic ideas to go on, I took the day off from the haxxor-news
site and pimped out the blog as best I could.

Tomorrow I'll start on the voting feature of haxxor-news, I'm confident it
will go smoothly and should be finished up by friday.
