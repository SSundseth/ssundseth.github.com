This morning I got the blog up and running, adding a bit of style along the way. When I saw Elias's
awesome setup with Jekyll-bootstrap I though about switching over but decided I needed the HTML/CSS
practice. At lunch I met the the developers from other offices while feasting on a sub from everyone's
favorite sandwich delivery: Jimmy John's. We talked for a good bit on some of the interesting projects
everyone is working on. In the afternoon everything was going well until I was hit right in the 
complacency by Patrick's email detailing our next project. I dove right into that, reading up on
Heroku and how it deploys Rails applications before attending a presentation on the history of our great
organization.

I'm still working on making the vigeblog look nice, want to add an archive and comments section and maybe
an RSS feed afterwards so my HTML education continues. Also looking forward to creating a real Rails
application and working with Heroku.
