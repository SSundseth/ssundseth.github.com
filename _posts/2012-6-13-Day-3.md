title: Riding the Rails
---

Added an archive and comments section to the blog this morning before meeting with David and
Chris to discuss the haxxor-news project. They walked me through a few of the fundamental
features of rails and the site got off to a good start. 
In the afternoon I worked on my own,
adding a page where users can submit links and configuring the routes of the site.

Still have a lot of work to do on the site but I've learned quite a bit about rails today
even though I'm only at the tip of the iceberg.
