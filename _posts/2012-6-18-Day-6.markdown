Today I put the finishing touches on the user-authentication functionality of the
haxxor-news site. The pull request for this feature received some helpful tips on
using RSpec so I spent a good portion of the day writing specs for the User model
and SessionController classes. Diving into the specs really gave me a good
understanding of how the classes are interacting as well.

Still learning about site layout and style with
HTML so I also made some minor changes to make haxxor-news look a little better.
