title: Code Review and Elo-System
---

Last Friday I sat down with David and Chris for a code review of haxxor-news.
Though the functionality was mostly complete, there were some rails conventions
and practices that I hadn't followed very closely. Most prominent was the
duplication of code across a few of the models and controllers so I pulled 
it out into modules that shared the methods to those models to avoid that
repetition.
I also learned about the Simplecov gem, which measures the coverage of your
test suite. Since mine wasn't 100%, I wrote some more specs as well.

Today I worked on officegam.es, finishing up the ranking algorithm so that it
implements the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo-rating system</a>. I plan on continuing to work on officegames this week before
transitioning to an app of my own creation for the second half of this
internship.
