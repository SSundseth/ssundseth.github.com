So the Haxxor News site is pretty much finished up. I spent today cleaning up
some lingering issues and rounding out the functionality with some small 
things. Aside from changes to the looks and maybe some small features this 
thing is done.

Some of the important things I've learned while working on this site:
<ul>
  <li>Rails syntax and MVC development</li>
  <li>The importance of testing your code</li>
  <li>Polymorphism in Rails</li>
</ul>

I could go into much more detail on these, I'll admit they are quite broad; but
they are the concepts that stand out when I think of how my knowledge has
progressed.

Once I come up with an idea, for the rest of the summer I'll be building my own
app using these and other features of rails.
