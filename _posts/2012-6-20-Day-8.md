title: Comments, comments everywhere

The lucky few who view my haxxor-news site will soon be able to post comments
all over the place. There are still some things to clean up so this feature
hasn't been deployed, but rest assured it is on its way. I had been plagued
with errors on the views for a while but 5 minutes of help from David cleared
things up and the rest will soon be history.

I also began writing some tests using the Capybara gem and added an rss feed
to the blog finally. Overall a pretty productive day.
