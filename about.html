<hr class="title">
I am Stefan Sundseth, a computer science major and baseball player at <a href="http://wesleyan.edu">Wesleyan University</a>.
This blog began as an account of my internship with <a href="http://viget.com">Viget</a> in the summer of 2012, and now I
post cool things I find through my classes and research.

Some websites I have created/worked on:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://ssundseth-haxxor-news.herokuapp.com">A Hacker News Clone (old)</a></li>
  <li> <a href="http://officegam.es">Office Games</a> (most of the work performed by Viget)</li>
  <li> <a href="http://stefansundseth.com">This Site</a></li>
  <li> <a href="http://uwharrie-offroad.herokuapp.com">Uwharrie Offroad</a></li>
</ul>

The code for most of these can be viewed at <a href="http://github.com/SSundseth">Github</a>, please feel free to check
stuff out and contribute!
