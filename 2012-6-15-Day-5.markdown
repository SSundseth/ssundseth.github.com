Friday saw me once again working on the haxxor-news site, this time working
to add a user authentication system to the site. I ended up using the 
'Clearance' gem to do this since it had basic functionality and was well-
documented.

It's been fun learning about Rails this week, the Model-View-Controller
method is making much more sense now that I've seen a few applications in
action and I think the next few added functionalities to the haxxor-news
site will go rather smoothly.
