title: Where is the Wifi
---

Thursday was a day of great distress for the Durham Vigeteers, for the
wireless internet was down. Some went home for the day, some visited local
coffee shops, and some packed up their things and headed west to look for the
internet. I remained at the office, doing what work I could locally. This
consisted of playing ping-pong in between writing integration tests with
Capybara.

Today the internet had returned and things were back to normal. At lunch the 
labshare given by Kevin provided interesting info about one of our clients, the
World Wildlife Fund. Afterwards I finally put out a pull request for the
comments feature and prepared for a relaxing weekend before moving on to letting
users vote on articles and comments.
